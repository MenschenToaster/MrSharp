# MrSharp ‚õè

MrSharp is a project to learn a bit of C# and do something on my Github page.
The work began with a small tutorial. Then I started to experiment myself.
Don't expect a big bot like Mee6. It's just a small and sharp project. :)

I will only make updates when I have time.

# The bot doesnt start or quit after starting

Make sure to copy the defaultconfig.json to your bin/debug/netcoreapp3.1 folder, rename it to config.json and fill it out.
