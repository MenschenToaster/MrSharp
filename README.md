# MrSharp ‚õè

MrSharp is a project to learn a bit of C# and do something on my Github page.
The work began with a small tutorial. Then I started to experiment myself.
Don't expect a big bot like Mee6. It's just a small and sharp project. :)

I will only make updates when I have time.
I didn't test it but I don't think the bot would even connect in the current state of the project.
